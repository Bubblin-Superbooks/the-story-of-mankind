<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">that I must tell you something about it in a separate chapter</p><p>The Greeks had always been fond of parades. Every year they held solemn processions in honor of Dionysos the God of the wine. As everybody in Greece drank wine (the Greeks thought water only useful for the purpose of swimming and sailing this particular Divinity was as popular as a God of the Soda-Fountain would be in our own land.)</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">And because the Wine-God was supposed to live in the vineyards, amidst a merry mob of Satyrs (strange creatures who were half man and half goat), the crowd that joined the procession used to wear goat-skins and to hee-haw like real billy-goats. The Greek word for goat is "tragos" and the Greek word for singer is "oidos." The singer who meh-mehed like a goat therefore was called a "tragos-oidos" or goat singer, and it is this strange name which developed into the modern word "Tragedy,"</p></div> </div>
