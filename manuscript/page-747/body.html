The new idea of "freedom" insisted that the state stand entirely aside and let commerce take its course.</p><p>The last half of the 18th century had not merely been a time of intellectual and political doubt, but the old economic ideas, too, had been replaced by new ones which better suited the need of the hour.

Turgot lived in a country which had suffered from too much red-tape, too many regulations, too many officials trying to enforce too many laws.
